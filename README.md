# My Personal Project
## An Academic Journal
\
**1. What will the application do?**
- This application is a combination of a grade summary and a journal.
- After the end of a term, the user can input what courses they
have taken in that particular semester.
The user will input the course name, undergraduate year they have taken the course, the semester they have taken the course, final grade, the professor, 
short description of the course's quality, and credit of that course.
 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ex.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Course Name: CPSC 210
\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year: 1 
\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term: 2
\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Grade: 96
\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor: Steve Wolfman
\
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary: I would have done better if I have
  watched the edX videos and focused on the 
  basic syntax instead of complex ideas.
- The application will store this data, so users can visit as if it 
is a journal. Also, the application will provide a grade summary of the year, 
calculating the average percentage and also the total credits the user has taken in the particular year. 
- The data will be categorized by undergraduate year, so the user can easily click on 
a particular year that they want to see the summary or data of. (ex. click on Year 2 to see the 
courses and grades they have gotten in second year)
  



**2. Who will use it?**
- University students will be using this application. 
- Those who 
want to keep their academic experience at university recorded. 
- This application will help the users achieve academic goals by
self reflecting, and track their academic progress and growth. 
- Also, after graduation, users can remember their university education 
and experience in a more accurate way. 



**3. Why is this project of interest to you?**
- I personally enjoy using planners and journals
to keep my personal goals and thoughts stored and remembered. 
However, I always found it very tedious and time consuming.
This application can provide a permanent record of my academic life
similar to a journal, but is much more specific to academics, organized,
and easy to input data. 
- As a first year student, this application will 
 help me build self-consciousness of my academics, 
creating good motivation and inspiration to achieve my academic goals. 
- Also, I want to remember specific details about the education I have received 
at UBC.
